Internet users esp. BSNL users generally have a scheme which allows users to download anything for free at wee hours, generally 2:00 AM to 8:00 AM . My vision to start creating this project is to cut their pain of waking up at mid night,  connecting to the web , logging in and at last starting the download ; additionally they have to wake up before its 8 o'clock , to pause the download and on the next day the history will repeat !!

So the wrath of my efforts may gonna spare you !!
